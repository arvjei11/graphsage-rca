Graph Sage is a full-stack, distributed observability platform designed to perform automated root-cause analysis in complex microservice environments. By leveraging a real-time data pipeline built with Docker, Kafka, and Elasticsearch, Graph Sage ingests and processes system logs to provide immediate insights into application health.

The core of the system is an intelligent AI agent that utilizes a Neo4j graph database as a "digital twin" of the application architecture. This allows Graph Sage to move beyond simple log searching and perform sophisticated, graph-based analysis to pinpoint the precise origin of failures, analyze their potential blast radius, and dramatically reduce Mean Time to Resolution (MTTR).
